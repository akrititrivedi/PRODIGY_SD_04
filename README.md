**Program Title: Sudoku Solver**

**Description:**
The "Sudoku Solver" program is a Java application designed to solve Sudoku puzzles automatically using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits without repetition. This program takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and employs a recursive backtracking approach to find the correct arrangement of numbers that satisfies the Sudoku rules.

**Features:**
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** The program employs a backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions while ensuring the puzzle constraints are satisfied.
- **Validation:** The program checks whether a number can be placed in a certain cell while considering the rules of Sudoku.
- **Solution Display:** If a valid solution exists, the program displays the completed Sudoku grid, showing the solved puzzle.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The program utilizes methods and classes to encapsulate different functionalities, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Ease of Use:** Users can input their unsolved Sudoku puzzles into the code for automatic solving.
- **Efficiency:** The backtracking approach efficiently explores possible solutions without exhaustive trial and error.

**How to Use:**
1. Input the unsolved Sudoku puzzle by modifying the `puzzle` array within the code.
2. Run the program using a Java compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).
3. If a valid solution exists, the program will display the completed Sudoku grid.

**Advantages:**
- Provides an automatic solution to Sudoku puzzles, saving time and effort in manual solving.
- Demonstrates the power of backtracking algorithms for solving complex logic-based puzzles.
- Offers an educational tool for understanding backtracking and problem-solving techniques.

**Limitations:**
- Limited to solving standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.
- May not handle puzzles with multiple solutions or invalid inputs.

**Target Audience:**
- Sudoku enthusiasts seeking quick solutions to puzzles.
- Students and programmers interested in learning about backtracking algorithms and problem-solving strategies.

**Overall, the "Sudoku Solver" program showcases the application of backtracking algorithms in solving Sudoku puzzles, offering a convenient tool for automatic puzzle solution and exploration of logical problem-solving techniques.**
